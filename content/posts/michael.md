Introduction:

My name is Michael Delgado and Im a Technology Management Major. I enjoy going to the gym on my free time and have dabbled in photography from time to time, specifically macro photography. I hope to succeed in a career path that has me surrounded with technology and networking equipment such as switches and routers or different OS systems to mess around with.
