Howdy everyone, my name is Jasmine Nguyen and I am a Junior from Houston, Texas! I am a Technology Management major with double minors in Cybersecurity and Business. I plan to pursue a career in Technology and Cybersecurity Consulting.

My hobbies include tennis, golf, crafting, and squishmallow hunting! I currently have 56 of them! My most recent find was a 24in dragon named Miles who loves technology as much as I do!
